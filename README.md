# Movies analysis

This is the first project I tried to do.This project is created only by my curiosity about cinema and my desire to enhance my coding skills. While there isn't a specific overarching question, my aim is to delve into various questions that cross my mind regularly. To achieve this, I've utilized two Kaggle datasets: one focusing on movies and the other on the Consumer Price Index (CPI).

Datasets Used:

Movie Dataset: Millions of Movies

This dataset provides a vast collection of information about movies, allowing for detailed exploration and analysis.
Consumer Price Index Dataset: US Inflation Data (Updated till May 2021)

The CPI dataset serves as a valuable resource for understanding economic trends, specifically inflation, which can be correlated with cinematic and entertainment industry developments.
